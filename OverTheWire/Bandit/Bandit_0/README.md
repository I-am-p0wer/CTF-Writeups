## Bandit_0


Bandit Level 0 → Level 1

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

Commands you may need to solve this level

ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

TIP: Create a file for notes and passwords on your local machine!

Passwords for levels are not saved automatically. If you do not save them yourself, you will need to start over from bandit0.

Passwords also occasionally change. It is recommended to take notes on how to solve each challenge. As levels get more challenging, detailed notes are useful to return to where you left off, reference for later problems, or help others after you’ve completed the challenge

## Solution

```bash
localhost:~# ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
